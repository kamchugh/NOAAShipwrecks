# NOAAShipwrecks

This project might be my personal favorite. I used public NOAA data to get a list of 6,000 shipwrecks across the world and create a program that allows the user to search shipwrecks by a variety of categories, and also allows the user to add, edit, or delete a shipwreck. I integrated google maps to show the exact location of the shipwreck - if you travel to that location the shipwreck will actually be there!
